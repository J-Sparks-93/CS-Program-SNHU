The over all problem set forth by this class was learning to and implementing various data structures and algorithms for a fictitious university to create a new software to help advisors in the Computer Science program recommend course plans with potential students. I approached the problem from the outset of this course with uncertainty as I still feel a bit green in relation to my coding experience, though as I progress, I slowly learn more about each topic being covered. In this setting I initially estimated I would have used vector sorting for this assignment, at the last moment I decided to implement a binary search tree, Though I still feel it wasn’t necessarily the best tool for the job, I done so to help gain experience and further understanding on topics I wasn’t feeling the most confident within this course. These data structures help organize a variety of datum that is acquired every nanosecond that we exist as a species. It structures and allows us to search for pertinent information that otherwise may be overlooked. 
I am beginning to see why it is said that a professional programmer will only code a few lines at a time, save, compile, and repeat. I find myself adapting to this mindset as I continue my program’s path. With proper comments, I find that code is becoming more readable and accessible to my knowledge base.
